# python-learning

To get this project on your local,
1. open a terminal and change directory (cd) to your GIT folder
2. type "git clone https://github.com/pawling11/python-learning.git"

Now you should have the respository contents on your harddrive.
To execute the test suite, type "python my_tests.py".
This will produce output from 3 failed tests. This is expected. Your job is to fix them.

To accomplish this, you must complete the method definitions in the myFunctions.py class for:

-myFirstFunction

-reverseFunction

-acronymOf


You can also type "python myFunctions.py" to get an idea of how your methods are working. I have written the main method to invoke the tested functions.
